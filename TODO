1. Both user/group perms functions that set the perms must return
   error if zero rows were affected.

2. Write a README.md file, maybe a document with a few examples.

3. Create indices for the various searchable non-TEXT columns in the
   schema for sqldb_auth.

4. Provide a way to query the schema.

5. Need to differentiate between returned columns that are NULL and
   returned columns that are empty strings.

6. Optimise the sqldb_query module to sort the queries array so that we
   can do a binary search when searching for a query.
