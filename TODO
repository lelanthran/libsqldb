1. Write a README.md file, maybe a document with a few examples.

2. Create indices for the various searchable non-TEXT columns in the
   schema for sqldb_auth.

3. Provide a way to query the schema.

4. Need to differentiate between returned columns that are NULL and
   returned columns that are empty strings.

5. Optimise the sqldb_query module to sort the queries array so that we
   can do a binary search when searching for a query.
