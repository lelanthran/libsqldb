1. Need to differentiate between returned columns that are NULL and
   returned columns that are empty strings.

2. Fix build process to use $(OUTPUT_DIRS) in the Makefile so that
   cross-compiling for different architectures and different releases
   (debug vs release) works.

3. Add in support in the sqldb for working with compile-time query-strings
   such as present in the sqldb_auth module:
      1. Allow the tables to contain common query strings as well as
         query-strings specific to particular SQL backends, as each
         backend may have different dialects that they support.
      2. Perform searching for query-strings using the currently selected
         backend as a priority.

4. Add in the login/logout/session commands to the cli interface. This
   also requires implementation of the respective three functions in the
   sqldb_auth module (hasn't been done yet).
