Problem with the mysql bits
---------------------------

The interface, after exec, is:
1. Caller calls step(), and that says whether there are records or not.
2. Caller calls scan_columns(), and that retrieves the next row into the the
bound results variables.

With MySQL, the caller must first bind values, then call store_result() which
will give us the number of rows. Unfortunately the caller simply calls step
without knowing what will be bound (that comes later).

The only way around this is to make a breaking change to the interface:
1. The caller must first call bind() to bind all the results.
2. The caller can then call step() for each record and the values will then
be filled in.

What to do, what to do, what to do???
