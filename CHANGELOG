## 0.1.5 - ???
Bug fixes
1. Bug in session creation that would sometimes create duplicate session IDs
   is now fixed.
2. API changed for sqldb_auth_session_valid() to return the email instead of
   requiring the email.
3. Foreign key bug in sqlite fixed.

Feature additions
1. Help messages corrected and made more informative where possible.

Other
1. License files for the contributed code (sha-356 and sqlite) added.

## 0.1.4 - Fri Jul  5 22:30:40 SAST 2019
Feature additions
1. Added support for flags column in the user table for the callers to use
   as they need (for example, to implement enabled/disabled accounts).
   Program sqldb_auth_cli updated to expose these functions to the end-user.

2. Added session management functions to allow user login, logout and session
   validation. Also added commands to the cli program to expose the session
   management to the end-user.

3. Added sqldb_query module to help manage query strings in the caller.
   Query strings can now be stored by the caller in a single array and this
   module will search for them by name and type. For example, a program
   which stores two different query strings with the same name for postgres
   and sqlite can use this module to find the correct one at runtime.

4. Added Windows support. Building on Windows still requires libpq and the
   associated headers.

Other
1. Changed build process to support cross-compiling in the future.

## 0.1.3 - Mon Jul  1 22:30:44 SAST 2019
Feature additions.
1. Added sqldb_auth module as part of this library. This feature provides
   the caller with the ability to perform user, group and permissions
   management using the selected SQL backend.

## 0.1.2 - Sun Jun 23 10:01:33 SAST 2019
Feature additions.
1. Added support for Postgres; unfortunately this requires libpq at
   compile time as well as at runtime (even if the caller never uses it)
   because the caller is allowed to select backends at runtime.

2. Added a batchfile function to read and execute SQL statements directly
   from a file; this is for SQL batch commands that are too large to fit
   in memory (such as a database dump).

3. Added a test script to run the tests for both postgres and sqlite, with
   optional valgrind support.

## 0.1.1 - 2019-04-14
Initial release, supports sqlite only.
