## 0.1.3 - ???
Feature additions.

## 0.1.2 - Sun Jun 23 10:01:33 SAST 2019
Feature additions.
1. Added support for Postgres; unfortunately this requires libpq at
   compile time as well as at runtime (even if the caller never uses it)
   because the caller is allowed to select backends at runtime.

2. Added a batchfile function to read and execute SQL statements directly
   from a file; this is for SQL batch commands that are too large to fit
   in memory (such as a database dump).

3. Added a test script to run the tests for both postgres and sqlite, with
   optional valgrind support.

## 0.1.1 - 2019-04-14
Initial release, supports sqlite only.
